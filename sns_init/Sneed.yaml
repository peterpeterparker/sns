  summary: |
    **I. Vision and Purpose**
    
    The core vision of Sneed DAO is to provide a community-driven ‘blank canvas’ model SNS DAO (as pioneered by SNS-1) to the ICP community and ecosystem.
    This model enables ICP community members and developers from all over the world to join and participate in shaping the DAO through proposals covering anything from new technological solutions to community-building projects, following the motto ‘by the community, for the community’.
    For more details please read our full SNS proposal posted on the DFINITY forums (please see link above).
    
    *dApp:*
    
    The Sneed converter dApp lets users convert their OLD Sneed tokens (currently in circulation) to the NEW Sneed DAO token, created for the Sneed SNS. 
    
    **II. Token Distribution**
    
    *Token Details:*
    
    * Token name: Sneed DAO
    * Token symbol: SNEED
    * Total token supply: 10,000 SNEED
    * Token distribution: 85% treasury, 10% decentralization sale, 5% Sneed founding team.
    * SNS ledger transaction fee: 0.00001 SNEED
    * Sneed dApp canister: 5ceyv-syaaa-aaaag-qc43q-cai
    
    Important note regarding token distribution! 
    
    The 85% treasury, 10% decentralization sale, 5% Sneed founding team allocation is the starting distribution specified by the SNS initialization parameters. 
    Because there is already an existing OLD Sneed token in circulation which will be convertible 1:1 (minus transaction fees) to the NEW Sneed DAO token created for the SNS, the following will end up becoming the actual allocation:
    
    19.5% treasury, 10% decentralization sale, 10% Sneed founding team, 60.1% Sneed converter dApp, and about 0.4% Burned. 
    
    The reason is that a majority of the NEW Sneed DAO tokens in the treasury will be sent to the Sneed converter dApp, so that holders of the OLD Sneed token can convert them to the NEW Sneed DAO token. 
    The Sneed founding team will (after burning 500 of their OLD Sneed tokens) own 500 OLD Sneed tokens and 500 NEW Sneed DAO tokens. 
    After converting their OLD Sneed tokens to NEW Sneed DAO tokens, the Sneed founding team will end up with 1,000 NEW Sneed DAO tokens, or 10% of the supply. 
    500 of the Sneed founding team's NEW Sneed DAO tokens will be locked in a neuron with 8 months vesting time and 1 month dissolve delay, and 500 will not be locked. 
    
    **III. Governance and Token Management**
    
    Post-sale, the Sneed Team will propose a series of actions:
    * Burn a corresponding amount of NEW Sneed DAO tokens as have been burnt from the OLD Sneed token supply (about 40 SNEED).
    * Burn the OLD Sneed token reserve (1,950 OLD Sneed in treasury, 1,000 OLD Sneed reserved for the SNS sale). 
    * Burn 500 of the 1,000 OLD Sneed tokens owned by the Sneed founding team. 
    * Send about 6,510 NEW Sneed DAO tokens (6,550 minus the amount of NEW Sneed DAO tokens burned in previous step) to the Sneed converter dApp, leaving 1,950 NEW Sneed DAO tokens in the SNS treasury (matching OLD Sneed token treasury).
    
    Burning 3,450 OLD Sneed tokens, and with about 40 OLD Sneed tokens already burned, gives 3,490 OLD Sneed tokens burned in total. This leaves about 6,510 OLD Sneed tokens in circulation. This matches the amount of NEW Sneed DAO tokens sent to the converter dApp, ensuring that all OLD Sneed tokens can be converted 1:1 (minus transaction fees) to new Sneed DAO tokens using the Sneed converter dApp.

# not affect all SNS proposals submitted to the newly created SNS.
Proposals:
  # The cost of making an SNS proposal that is rejected by the SNS neuron
  # holders. This field is specified as a token. For example: "1 token".
  rejection_fee: 0.1 token

  # The initial voting period of an SNS proposal. A proposal's voting period
  # may be increased during its lifecycle due to the wait-for-quiet algorithm
  # (see details below). This field is specified as a duration. For example
  # "4 days".
  initial_voting_period: 4 days

  # The wait-for-quiet algorithm extends the voting period of a proposal when
  # there is a flip in the majority vote during the proposal's voting period.
  maximum_wait_for_quiet_deadline_extension: 1 day

# Configuration of SNS voting.
Neurons:
  # The minimum amount of SNS tokens to stake a neuron. This field is specified
  # as a token. For instance, "1 token".
  minimum_creation_stake: 0.01 tokens

# Configuration of SNS voting.
Voting:
  # The minimum dissolve delay a neuron must have to be able to cast votes on
  # proposals.
  #
  # Dissolve delay incentivizes neurons to vote in the long-term interest of
  # an SNS, as they are rewarded for longer-term commitment to that SNS.
  #
  # Users cannot access the SNS tokens used to stake neurons (until the neuron
  # is dissolved). This field is specified as a duration. For example: "6 months".
  minimum_dissolve_delay: 1 month

  # Configuration of voting power bonuses that are applied to neurons to
  # incentivize alignment with the best interest of the DAO. Note, these
  # bonuses multiply each other, so the increase in voting power due to
  # the dissolve delay bonus is used in the equation to increase voting
  # power for the age bonus.
  MaximumVotingPowerBonuses:
    # Users with a higher dissolve delay are incentivized to take the
    # long-term interests of the SNS into consideration when voting. To
    # reward this long-term commitment, this bonus can be set to a
    # percentage greater than zero, which will result in neurons having
    # their voting power increased in proportion to their dissolve delay.
    #
    # For example, if the user has a dissolve delay of 6 months, and
    # the maximum dissolve delay duration (defined below as `duration`)
    # for the dissolve delay bonus is 12 months, and the maximum bonus
    # (defined as `bonus` below) is set to 10%, then that user’s voting
    # power will be 105% of their normal voting power based on staked
    # tokens (i.e. they will have a bonus of 5%). If the user increased
    # their dissolve delay to 9 months, they would get 107.5% of the normal
    # voting power of their tokens. And if they increased to 12 months, they
    # would get 110%. If they increase further, they get no additional bonus.
    #
    # If you do not want this bonus to be applied for neurons with higher
    # dissolve delay, set `bonus` to `0%` and those neurons will not receive
    # higher voting power.
    DissolveDelay:
      # This parameter sets the maximum dissolve delay a neuron can have.
      # When reached, the maximum dissolve delay bonus will be applied.
      # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "8 years".
      duration: 6 months
      # If a neuron's dissolve delay is `duration`, its voting power will
      # be increased by the dissolve delay `bonus` amount.
      # This field is specified as a percentage. For instance,
      # a value of "100%" means that the voting power will be doubled
      # (multiplied by 2).
      bonus: 100%

    # Users with neurons staked in the non-dissolving state for a long
    # period of time are incentivized to take the long-term interests of
    # the SNS into consideration when voting. To reward this long-term
    # commitment, this bonus can be set to a percentage (greater than zero),
    # which will result in neurons having their voting power increased in
    # proportion to their age.
    #
    # For example, if the neuron has an age of 6 months, and the maximum age
    # duration (defined below as `duration`) for the age bonus is 12 months,
    # and the maximum bonus (defined as `bonus` below) is set to 10%, then
    # that neuron’s voting power will be 105% of their normal voting power
    # based on staked tokens plus dissolve delay bonus (i.e. they will have a
    # bonus of 5%). If neuron aged another 3 months to have an age of 9 months,
    # the neuron would get 107.5% of the normal voting power. And if the neuron
    # aged another 3 months to 12 months, the neuron would get 110%. If the neuron
    # ages further, it get no additional bonus.
    #
    # If this bonus should not be applied for older neurons, set the bonus
    # to `0%` and older neurons will not receive higher voting power.
    Age:
      # This parameter sets the duration of time the neuron must be staked
      # in the non-dissolving state, in other words its `age`, to reach
      # the maximum age bonus. Once this age is reached, the neuron will
      # continue to age, but no more bonus will be applied. This field
      # is specified as a duration. For example: "2 years".
      duration: 1 year
      # If a neuron's age is `duration` or older, its voting power will be
      # increased by this age`bonus` amount.
      # This field is specified as a percentage. For instance,
      # a value of "25%" means that the voting power will increase by a quarter
      # (multiplied by 1.25).
      bonus: 25%

  # Configuration of SNS voting reward parameters.
  #
  # The voting reward rate controls how quickly the supply of the SNS token
  # increases. For example, setting `initial` to `2%` will cause the supply to
  # increase by at most `2%` per year. A higher voting reward rate
  # incentivizes users to participate in governance, but also results in
  # higher inflation.
  #
  # The initial and final reward rates can be set to have a higher reward rate
  # at the launch of the SNS and a lower rate further into the SNS’s lifetime.
  # The reward rate falls quadratically from the `initial` rate to the `final`
  # rate over the course of `transition_duration`.
  #
  # Setting both `initial` and `final` to `0%` will result in the system not
  # distributing voting rewards at all.
  #
  # More details on SNS tokenomics can be found in the developer documentation:
  # https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/rewards/#voting-rewards
  RewardRate:
    # The initial reward rate at which the SNS voting rewards will increase
    # per year. This field is specified as a percentage. For example: "15%".
    initial: 0%

    # The final reward rate at which the SNS voting rewards will increase
    # per year. This rate is reached after `transition_duration` and remains
    # at this level unless changed by an SNS proposal. This field is
    # specified as a percentage. For example: "5%".
    final: 0%

    # The voting reward rate falls quadratically from `initial` to `final`
    # over the time period defined by `transition_duration`.
    #
    # Values of 0 result in the reward rate always being `final`.
    #
    # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "8 years".
    transition_duration: 0 years

# Configuration of the initial token distribution of the SNS. You can configure
# how SNS tokens are distributed in each of the three groups:
# (1) tokens that are given to the original developers of the dapp,
# (2) treasury tokens that are owned by the SNS governance canister, and
# (3) tokens which are distributed to the decentralization swap participants.
#
# The initial token distribution must satisfy the following preconditions to be
# valid:
#    - The sum of all developer tokens in E8s must be less than `u64::MAX`.
#    - The Swap's initial balance (see group (3) above) must be greater than 0.
#    - The Swap's initial balance (see group (3) above) must be greater than or
#      equal to the sum of all developer tokens.
Distribution:
  # The initial neurons created when the SNS Governance canister is installed.
  # Each element in this list specifies one such neuron, including its stake,
  # controlling principal, memo identifying this neuron (every neuron that
  # a user has must be identified by a unique memo), dissolve delay, and a
  # vesting period. Even though these neurons are distributed at genesis,
  # they are locked in a (restricted) pre-initialization mode until the
  # decentralization swap is completed. Note that `vesting_period` starts
  # right after the SNS creation and thus includes the pre-initialization mode
  # period.
  #
  # For example:
  #  - principal: hpikg-6exdt-jn33w-ndty3-fc7jc-tl2lr-buih3-cs3y7-tftkp-sfp62-gqe
  #    stake: 1_000 tokens
  #    memo: 0
  #    dissolve_delay: 2 years
  #    vesting_period: 4 years
  Neurons:
    # For the actual SNS launch, you should replace this with one or more
    # principals of your intended genesis neurons.

Swap:
  # The minimum number of direct participants that must participate for the

  # Must be smaller than or equal than `maximum_direct_participation_icp`.
  minimum_direct_participation_icp: 100 tokens

  # Maximum amount of ICP from direct participants. If this amount is achieved,
  # the swap will finalize immediately, without waiting for the due date/time;
  # in this case, the swap would be committed if and only if the number of
  # direct participants (`minimum_participants`) is reached (otherwise, it
  # would be aborted).
  # Must be at least `min_participants * minimum_direct_participation_icp`.
  maximum_direct_participation_icp: 30_000 tokens

  # The minimum amount of ICP that each participant must contribute

  # Configuration of the vesting schedule of the neuron basket, i.e., the SNS
  # neurons that a participants will receive from a successful
  # decentralization swap.
  VestingSchedule:
    # The number of events in the vesting schedule. This translates to how
    # many neurons will be in each participant's neuron basket. Note that
    # the first neuron in each neuron basket will have zero dissolve delay.
    # This value should thus be greater than or equal to `2`.
    events: 2

    # The interval at which the schedule will be increased per event. The
    # first neuron in the basket will be unlocked with zero dissolve delay.
    # Each other neuron in the schedule will have its dissolve delay
    # increased by `interval` compared to the previous one. For example,
    # if `events` is set to `3` and `interval` is `1 month`, then each
    # participant's neuron basket will have three neurons (with equal stake)
    # with dissolve delays zero, 1 month, and 2 months. Note that the notion
    # of `Distribution.neurons.vesting_period` applies only to developer
    # neurons. While neuron basket neurons do not use `vesting_period`, they
    # have a vesting schedule. This field is specified as a duration. For
    # example: "1 month".
    interval: 1 month

  # Absolute time of day when the decentralization swap is supposed to start.
  #
  # An algorithm will be applied to allow at least 24 hours between the time
  # of execution of the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal and swap start.
  # For example, if start_time is 23:30 UTC and the proposal is adopted and
  # executed at 23:20 UTC, then the swap start will be at 23:30 UTC the next
  # day (i.e., in 24 hours and 10 min from the proposal execution time).
  #
  # WARNING: Swap start_time works differently on mainnet and in testing.
  #
  # On mainnet:
  # - Setting start_time to some value (e.g., 23:30 UTC) will allow the swap
  #   participants to be prepared for the swap in advance, e.g.,
  #   by obtaining ICPs that they would like to participate with.
  # - If start_time is not specified, the actual start time of the swap will
  #   be chosen at random (allowing at least 24 hours and less than 48 hours,
  #   as described above).
  #
  # In testing:
  # - Setting start_time to some value works the same as explained above.
  # - If start_time is not specified, the swap will begin immediately after
  #   the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal is executed. This facilitates
  #   testing in an accelerated manner.
  #
  # start_time: 23:30 UTC  # Intentionally commented out for testing.

  # The duration of the decentralization swap. When `start_time` is calculated
  # during CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal execution, this `duration` will
  # be added to that absolute time and set as the swap's deadline.
